The first question that people ask when you start a new thing is 'Why that?'  The thought process behind why you choose to pursue something, whether a hobby or a career, is always interesting.  I've spent a lot of years coaching high school students on making college/career choices, and it's always something different.  So here in this space, I want to talk through why I am chosing coding as my next career.

There is something special about creating something.  It's a process that I have found enjoyment in through many different mediums.  Whether it is carpentry, music, teaching or now coding, the process of crafting something has always been very enjoyable for me.  It isn't always about coming up with this new great thing, sometimes it is something as simple as a table(I've built several).  It's about creating something from raw materials and making it better.

Coding offers a unique ability to create something out of pretty much nothing.  You take the languages that are there and create something beautiful and functional with it.  I started teaching myself some basic coding back in my high school days and continued to grow in college.  It was something I enjoyed a great deal then.  Now I'm excited to get back into it and learn so many new things and learn new ways to create.
