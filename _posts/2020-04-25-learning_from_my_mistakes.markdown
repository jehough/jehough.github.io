In the last month, I decided it wasn't a good idea for me to stick with just Ruby as my backend language of choice.  Given the job market, it seemed like a good idea to move ahead and try to pick up something else.  At first I thought the best thing for me to do was .Net.  I still believe that is a great framework, and I do intend to finish what I started with it, but I made some mistakes when I went to learn it and it has made it very difficult for me.  Now, I have decided to move forward with Node.js and Express.  This is what I am going to do differently.

First, I'm going to start with the basics and take it slowly.  With .Net I felt that all I really needed to do was translate what I already know about Rails and translate it into .Net syntax.  Unfortunately that is fraught with all kinds of problems.  First of all the language difference is very real.  Many of the syntax things are the same, but every language has it's own nuances that make or break working with it.  To my detriment, I skipped taking time to learn the nuances of C# before jumping into the framework and it made understanding things much more difficult.  Fortunately, with Node.js, I am very familiar with JavaScript and it's nuances.  I am also starting with the simple app stuff(routes and models) before jumping to the complex(authorization).

Secondly, I'm going to avoid using generators.  Most tutorials for beginners with .Net start with the generators.  It has very powerful generators that can get a full site up with database and all in a matter of minutes.  Unfortunately, once you have done that, it's harder to go back and try to see all the pieces of the puzzle.  So with Node.js, I'm starting from scratch as much as I can and adding middleware and packages as I go to help me understand what every piece actually does.

Finally, I'm doing lots of smaller things.  My first thought with .Net is just get out of the gate running and build a cool project I can add to my portfolio and I'll learn all the pieces as I go.  This was a huge mistake as the size of the project got quickly overwhelming.  This time I'm going do easy pages with small functionalities and then once I've got the gist of the whole thing put it all together in a big project.

I'm looking forward to this new venture with Node.js.  Hopefully this will be a smoother process.
