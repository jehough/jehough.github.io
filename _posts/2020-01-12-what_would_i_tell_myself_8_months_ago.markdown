For the last 8 months I have been working through the Learn Coding Bootcamp.  My goal in this was to learn the skills necessary to get a job in web development.  I have enjoyed the journey and have learned a tremendous amount in that time.  As with anything you finish, it's a good time to look back on the journey and think about what you would have told yourself at the beginning.

The first thing I'd probably tell myself is to go ahead and work ahead.  At first I was concerned about getting to far ahead of my schedule because of timing with my current job.  I wanted the timing to work out right, so I kept myself from getting too far ahead.  Looking back I don't think that was a good idea.  There is an emmense amount of information beyond what the course provides.  Had I gotten more ahead, I could be spending more time now exploring more cool things.  I'm very excited about continuing the learning process in the future, and I think pressing forward could have helped with that.

The second thing I would say is be curious.  In a similar vein as the previous point, there is so much out there, so many cool things that you can do in programming.  Don't limit yourself to what is in the program, but look everywhere for more to learn.  Even the stuff you learn, there are people who think it should be done differently, and looking at the different points of view is really helpful in gaining a deeper understanding.

Finally, I would say be patient.  At the beginning of the course I would often get frustrated when I didn't understand how to get the right set up, or why something was supposed to go a certain way.  As I began to understand more, I began to realize that programming is really more of a way of thinking more than it is a right and wrong answer.  You would think as a Precalculus teacher I would understand that already, since I tell my students that all the time, but I guess I still had a bit to learn. 

It's been a really fun journey and I am genuinely looking forward to learning so much more.
